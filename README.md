## Where can I find what?

- Pages are stored in `app/templates`
- Snippets are often stored in `app/snippets`

## Adding a new page

- Add your page in `app/templates`
- Add the route in `app/router.js`
- Add the route in possible sidebars/overview pages/etc...

## Add a language for code highlighting
Most languages should be available out of the box. 
Please adjust the files accordingly:

- `app/instance-initializers/marked.js`
